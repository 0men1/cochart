-------------DEVS-------------

To run both server & web:
``` make dev ```


TASKS (ordered by priority):
- Separate shared state from per-user state
- Regression tests
- Add more chart interactions
   - easier chart paging, 
   - tool hotbar, 
   - list of drawing objects

Requirements
- Get a better drawing system (provide more tool options)
   - The drawing system can be greatly improved. fork LWC and extend to drag drawings and their control points.


PROBLEM DISCOVERY:
- Issues on mobile (Connections are established but deltas are not visibly updating the state (indexdb issue))
