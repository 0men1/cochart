-------------DEVS-------------

This project has been containerized so it is possible to run both server & web with just one command.

Run this command in the root directory:
``` make dev ```


TASKS:
- Separate shared state from per-user state?
- Add more chart interactions (easier chart paging, open/close tabs, drawings hotbar, reset chart, clear cache)

Requirements
- Get a better drawing system
   - The drawing system can be greatly improved. fork LWC and extend to drag drawings and their control points.
