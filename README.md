-------------DEVS-------------

To run both server & web:
``` make dev ```


TASKS (ordered by priority):
- Regression tests
- Add more chart interactions
   - list of drawing objects

Requirements
- Get a better drawing system (provide more tool options)
   - The drawing system can be greatly improved. fork LWC and extend to drag drawings and their control points.
   - FORKED! Now working to improve the drawing system internally rather than do workarounds

PROBLEM DISCOVERY:
- Issues on mobile (Connections are established but deltas are not visibly updating the state (indexdb issue))
